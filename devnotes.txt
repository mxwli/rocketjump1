implementation peculiars:

world is made of collidable CSGmeshes
staticbodies appear to work as well

special functions on touch come from groups that CSGCombiners are in
Restarters to reset player position to checkpoint
	once the player collisionhull intersects, the reset is done

Checkpoint to set player checkpoint
	the checkpoint is the last position where the player collision intersected with the checkpoint collision

Absorbant to absorb rocket explosions
	if the raycast from the rocket hits an absorbant material, an exlposion is not created

Dialogue is a very special case
	objects in the Dialogue group have at least two children:
		Dialogue
			Its children are a list of RichTextLabels. the bbcode_text of these labels is the dialogue info
			to be pushed onto the queue
			if the label has a script with an `event` member, then the event member is treated like a function
			and called
		Pictures
			Its children are a list of TextureRects. the texture of these rects is the texture info to be pushed
			onto the queue
